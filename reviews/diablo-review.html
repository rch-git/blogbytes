<p>Diablo is a simple RPG made by Blizzard, in 1996. The premise of the game is very simple, explore the depths of the
    church and kill all the monsters. Yet, the game manages to be very complex and satisfying, because the number of
    ways the levels can be finished are numerous.</p>

<p>The story is like this: Tristram, once a peaceful town, has entered dark times when it was attacked by demons and it
    is up to you to save the town and its inhabitants. There is a lot more to the story than this, but I'll leave it for
    you to find out.</p>

<p>The player gets to choose from three different classes of characters – the warrior, the rogue and the sorcerer. Each
    class has a different approach to combat.</p>

<p>The warrior specializes in melee combat, effectively using swords and axes. The rogue relies on accuracy; with high
    dexterity, the rogue can kill enemies before they have a chance to get close. The sorcerer can cast spells
    destroying enemies with the use of magic.</p>

<p>The experience will be very different depending on the class of the character. The warrior can rush into battle,
    while the rogue and sorcerer have to use the hit-and-run strategy at times.</p>

<p>As the game progresses the player gets to level up, and develop the character. Strength, Dexterity, Vitality and
    Magic can be improved with progress. New weapons or new spells will be unlocked giving rise to a number of different
    ways in which a same level can be played.</p>

<p>Another huge positive aspect of the game is the replay value. Each time a new character is created the levels are
    generated randomly, which means that Level 1 with a character is not the same as Level 1 with another character. So
    even if the game is completed, it can be replayed using a different character and the levels are never repeated.</p>

<p>Although the game is linear in its conclusion, that is no matter which character is chosen, the ending is always
    same, the path to the ending is always different. To have implemented this when almost all other games during its
    time are strictly linear makes Diablo stand apart from the rest.</p>

<p>The game is not without its faults or fault as I can only think of one. I thought the whole idea of going through
    levels back and forth to visit the town was a little tedious, but that didn't stop me from playing the game, and
    I'll have you know that I am playing the game again with a different character. The game is that good.</p>

<p>Even after 11 years of its release, Diablo is still regarded as one of the best games of all time. New generation of
    gamers may not be acquainted with this game, but I think it should be tried by everyone. If you manage to look past
    the graphics, Diablo has a lot to offer.</p>
