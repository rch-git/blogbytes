<p><b><i>I finished this game on Thursday, September 3, 2009, 3:02:00 AM. This review was first published on GameSpot on
            October 1, 2009.</i></b></p>

<p>When Wolfenstein was first announced back in 2005, I had very high hopes. I could not wait to play it. Return to
    Castle Wolfenstein remains one of my favorite games. Having played Soldier of Fortune and enjoying it immensely, I
    was happy to know Raven would be in charge of the development. After playing Quake 4, I was confident it would be
    fantastic.</p>

<p>Four years later, I am not sure if am entirely happy with the game.</p>

<p>B.J Blazkowicz returns as the protagonist to fight against the Nazis. The game begins with Blazkowicz on a Nazi
    warship getting ready to launch missiles on London. He battles the Nazi soldiers on the ship and makes a last minute
    getaway with the help of a medallion with mystical powers. He discovers that the medallion contains crystals which
    are found in in Isenstadt, and that the leader of the excavation is a Nazi general named General Zetta. Blazkowicz
    goes to Isenstadt to uncover the secret, and meets with the agents of rebel forces from the Kreisau Cricle and the
    an occult group called the Golden Dawn in order to end the control of Nazi's over Isenstadt. There is plenty of
    action throughout, with lots of weapons. Flamethrower and Leichenfaust44 deserve a mention here. Leichenfaust44 is
    Wolfenstein's version of BFG - its fantastic.</p>

<p>Almost the entire game is set in the city of Isenstadt. The game is somewhat linear, you need to travel through the
    city to various locations to access missions. The city is well created but there are some nagging flaws in the
    execution. The game tries to be an open world game, but it doesn't quite live up to that and it feels contrived. For
    example, when you backtrack to a location within the city, everything is respawned including enemies and fuel
    barrels! That just feels really wrong especially when you shot the very fuel barrel less than 10 minutes ago. It
    immediately has an effect on immersion, and feels like a cheap trick to create an illusion of an open world. The
    changes are not persistent. After a battle in an area, should you leave it and return, there will be absolutely no
    sign of anything, and enemies will be back in their place, going about their patrol. No lessons learned from
    STALKER, because its Diablo 2 style monster respawn - seeing this in a first person shooter and Wolfenstein at that,
    just didn't feel right.</p>

<p>Highlight of the game are the veil powers that the medallion lets you have; a slightly different version of Nano suit
    from Crysis. Once accessed, the veil takes over and everything turns green - basically lets the player into an
    alternate universe. This allows the player to spot enemies easily, move faster, access hidden location, increase
    damage, and acquire shield which can deflect enemy bullets. I thought the visual effects in the veil were very well
    done. Taking down enemies with these powers is a lot of fun.</p>

<p>There is a certain RPG element in the game as well - you get to upgrade veil power and existing weapons. This can be
    done by completing missions and earning cash rewards and then going to the nearest Black Market and spending them on
    veil power and/or weapons.</p>

<p>Soundtrack is really good, and audio, as in weapon sounds and sound effects, is quite impressive. The voice acting -
    not so much. The fake German accent is cringe-worthy.</p>

<p>The game is built on Doom 3 engine. Its not spectacular, but I had no issues with the visuals at all. My biggest
    complaint with the game is the gameplay - it just does not feel like an id game. Let me give you an example.</p>

<p>You are in a big room, with all doors locked and enemies are attacking you, you manage to defeat the enemies and the
    door automatically opens for no particular reason. I understand the reason this has to be so, but here is where it
    failed badly. One of the enemies was half dead - the enemy wouldn't move and I naturally assumed it to be dead, yet
    the door wouldn't open because all the enemies are not completely dead. I spent about 20 minutes trying all possible
    ways to get out of the room, when i suddenly realized, all corpses vanished except for the one in the corner, so I
    shot at it, and pop! The door opens.</p>

<p>You kill the final two bosses multiple times - four and three respectively. I thought those boss battles were boring,
    and given the fact that there is no quick save in the PC version (!), it was frustrating as well. Half-Life 2
    managed to deliver fantastic endings just fine without any lame design to prolong gameplay, in fact prolonging the
    gameplay was never an issue. That clearly is the concern here, for I see no reason for some very stupid design
    decisions - the door opening for example. Scripted gameplay is fine if its done right, but in this case, the
    developers employed some very archaic methods at linear gameplay. If in a Mario game, you had a room full of
    enemies, and you have to defeat all of them for the door to open, it probably makes sense, but in a 'serious' first
    person shooter, an innocuous door staying locked for no reason while enemies are alive...just doesn't cut it. This
    could have been done a lot better if some thought went into it.</p>

<p>To me, Wolfenstein is a disappointment. I feel sorry for fans of the series who paid full price for this, expecting a
    game in the same league as Return to Castle Wolfenstein, which this clearly isn't. I don't hate consoles, but its a
    shame when a PC game is built with console gamers in mind, and given that fact that this series is a PC classic just
    makes it worse.</p>

<p>Is this a bad game? Technically, its not. Is this something worthy of id software/Raven? No. Not from the people who
    made Doom 3 and Quake 4.</p>
