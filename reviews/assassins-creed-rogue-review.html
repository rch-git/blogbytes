<p>I started playing Assassin's Creed Rogue right after I finished Black Flag. I went from not playing an Assassin's Creed in over two years to playing them back to back. Please be warned that this review will contain spoilers because I will discuss the story.</p>

<p>I learned about the existence of this game while I was reading a review of Black Flag. The idea of a Black Flag like game set in North America felt very interesting to me. I really liked Black Flag, and I did not mind more of it. When I saw a picture of a ship with the northern lights in the background, I was sold.  </p>

<p>I went scouring for a deal, and I found it on Fanatical. I paid $8.99 for the Deluxe Edition. I do not know what the difference between the Standard and Deluxe editions is. In general I am not a fan of how companies carve out content and sell it as different editions, which is solely designed to nickel and dime gamers. </p>
