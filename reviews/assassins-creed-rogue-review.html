<p>I started playing Assassin's Creed Rogue right after I finished Black Flag. I went from not playing an Assassin's Creed in over two years to playing them back to back. Please be warned that this review will contain spoilers because I will discuss the story.</p>

<p>I learned about the existence of this game while I was reading a review of Black Flag. The idea of a Black Flag like game set in North America felt very interesting to me. I really liked Black Flag, and I did not mind more of it. When I saw a picture of a ship with the northern lights in the background, I was sold.  </p>

<p>I went scouring for a deal, and I found it on Fanatical. I paid $8.99 for the Deluxe Edition. I do not know what the difference between the Standard and Deluxe editions is. In general I am not a fan of how companies carve out content and sell it as different editions, which is solely designed to nickel and dime gamers. However, the price of the Deluxe edition seemed acceptable to me.</p>

<p>Apparently this game was released on the same day as Assassin's Creed Unity. In addition to this, the game was fully priced at launch (of course it is), which might explain why the game wasn't as popular. It doesn't seem as well received as Black Flag, and it understandable. The premise is very interesting, but it was poorly executed.</p>
