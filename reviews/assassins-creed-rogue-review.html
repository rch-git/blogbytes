<p>I started playing Assassin's Creed Rogue right after I finished Black Flag. I went from not playing an Assassin's Creed in over two years to playing them back to back. Please be warned that this review will contain spoilers because I will discuss the story.</p>

<p>I learned about the existence of this game while I was reading a review of Black Flag. The idea of a Black Flag like game set in North America felt very interesting to me. I really liked Black Flag, and I did not mind more of it. When I saw a picture of a ship with the northern lights in the background, I was sold.  </p>

<p>I went scouring for a deal, and I found it on Fanatical. I paid $8.99 for the Deluxe Edition. I do not know what the difference between the Standard and Deluxe editions is. In general I am not a fan of how companies carve out content and sell it as different editions, which is solely designed to nickel and dime gamers. However, the price of the Deluxe edition seemed acceptable to me.</p>

<p>Apparently this game was released on the same day as Assassin's Creed Unity. In addition to this, the game was fully priced at launch (of course it is), which might explain why the game wasn't as popular. It doesn't seem as well received as Black Flag, and it understandable. The premise is very interesting, but it was poorly executed.</p>

<h2>Story</h2>
<br /><b><i>SPOILER WARNING</i></b>
<p>In Assassin's Creed Rogue, you get to play as Shay Patrick Cormac. He is a part of the Colonial Brotherhood of Assassins, working in North America during the Seven Years' War. He is tasked with retrieving a piece of Eden, which sends him to Lisbon. He locates the piece of Eden underneath a Church. As he tries to retrieve the piece of Eden, it triggers an earthquake in Lisbon. There apparently was a massive earthquake in Lisbon in 1755, so I guess I learned something new. Anyhow, Shay realizes that the Assassin's see this as a means to an end, and plan on retrieving all the pieces, even if it meant there could be death and destruction. This causes him to question his loyalty to his side, and he eventually ends up joining the templars.</p>

<p>Those that played all Assassin's Creed III and Unity will appreciate how the game attempts to tie up some loose ends. Not having played either of those games as of this writing, I am yet to appreciate the gravity of the plotlines.</p>

<p>Everything about how the story is told seemed very rushed. The transition from an Assassin to a Templar is very jarring. One moment, you are an Assassin, and in the next mission, you are a Templar sworn to rid the world of Assassins. The transition didn't feel natural to me. It felt like it was done in a very haphazard manner to move the plot along. If this game had gotten the attention it deserved, and if it was fleshed out a little bit more, it could have easily eclipsed Black Flag. As such, it has the feel of a budget title.</p>

<p>When I watch the footage from the game, and also compare the screenshots with Black Flag, I can't help but get the feeling that the visuals are very washed out in Rogue. One might argue that the saturation levels in Black Flag are a bit much, but I really liked the vibrant world of the Caribbean. North America on the other hand, looks very dreary. I can understand that this might the look they are going for, but the lack of any vibrancy is particularly noticeable even in areas with vegetation, or New York where its populated, and there was definitely room to make the game look more interesting. Instead it feels as if the entire area has generic buildings, one area is not very distinguishable from the other.  </p>
