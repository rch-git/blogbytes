<p>Much has changed in gaming since the early 90's, and old school gamers would have been delighted to know that a
    sequel to one of the most famous games during its time, Wolfenstein 3D, is going to be released in the new
    millennium. Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a successor to Wolfenstein 3D that was released over a decade ago;
    Wolfenstein has come of age and is keeping up with the times.</p>

<p>The game is set in 1943 Germany, the player returns as U.S. Army Ranger B.J. Blazkowicz, who is captured and is being
    held in the dungeons of Castle Wolfenstein. Upon escaping the castle, a plot is unveiled involving Nazi experiments
    into cybernetics and the occult to gain supremacy over the Allied forces.</p>

<p>The game uses Quake 3 engine to render the beautiful graphics seen throughout. Nvidia users will be treated with
    improved textures that will make a lot of difference. The snowing mountain ranges of Germany are wonderfully
    recreated. The cobblestone paved roadways and bridges, and castle interiors are a work of art.</p>

<p>The catacombs are very reminiscent of levels in Quake 3, they have an eerie atmosphere and while the game is not
    meant to be scary, they do manage to make you feel a little uneasy.</p>

<p>The combat is very engaging and the cable car part in the game seems to have been taken right out of Where Eagles
    Dare. Very well done.</p>

<p>The AI in the game is very competent, and you will be dealing with a lot of different types of enemies, living and
    the undead. They do not rush at you squeezing rounds or waving their arms about; instead they take cover, throw
    grenades, making your progress harder. The perception of the AI has also been considered. They can hear footsteps or
    any noise that the player might make. So if you fire a shot in room, expect the soldiers in the other room to hear
    it and attack you. While the AI is not the greatest, it will still provide a challenge.</p>

<p>The weapons models belong to the World War II era, you get to use the Luger, Thompson, Sten gun, the German
    Panzerfäuste, chain gun and something called a Tesla cannon. This is a heavy weapon that sends rays of electric
    current in all directions. It's not the most effective weapon but it's quite fun to use at times.</p>

<p>Speaking of fun to use weapons, the flamethrower has got to be one of the best weapons I ever used. The flame effects
    are still regarded one of the finest in gaming. I remember people being mesmerized when they first got to see the
    screenshots of the flamethrower, and personally, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it in the game.</p>

<p>The sounds of the weapons are very realistic, and the music adds a lot to the experience. The soundtrack in this game
    isn't talked about a lot, surprisingly. I thought it was really good.</p>

<p>Return to Castle Wolfenstein is an excellent game that will offer a little over 10 hours of very engrossing gameplay.
    I am thoroughly satisfied with this game. It does not break any boundaries, but provides a solid experience.</p>
