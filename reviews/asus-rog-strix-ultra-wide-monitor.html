<p>I purchased this monitor on <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09DQ6RFTN?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details" target="_blank">Amazon</a> for $699. Then the price of monitor went down by $10 while the package was enroute. I decided to contact the seller and asked them if they could give me a discount, and they responded shortly, and gave me a $10 refund. Very generous of them.</p>

<p>The monitor is a renewed model. I did not notice any issues with the monitor, cosmetic or otherwise. I got all the accessories, like display port, HDMI, USB-C cables etc. The price of the new model is $799 as of this writing (5/13/2022).</p>

<p>Setting up the monitor is very simple. Its just a matter of assembling the base, and mounting the display onto it. Once the monitor was assembled, I connected to the PC via a display port cable. At startup, the monitor has a refresh rate of 144Hz. I went into the monitor menu and overclocked it to 180Hz. The process is quite easy and it takes effect immediately.</p>

<p>Needless to say to run games at 3440x1440 resolution, and at such a high refresh rate, a powerful GPU is needed. I am currently running an <a href="https://www.newegg.com/msi-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-rtx-3080-ti-gaming-x-trio-12g/p/N82E16814137650?Item=N82E16814137650" target="_blank">MSI GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12GB Gaming X Trio</a>. I would not recommend upgrading to this monitor unless there is a capable GPU powering the machine. I think a 1080Ti or an AMD equivalent is probably a minimum for a 1440p ultrawide monitor.</p>

<p>Games look absolutely fantastic on this monitor. Prior to the upgrade, I was playing on <a href="https://www.blogbytes.net/2015/01/asus-rog-swift-pg278q.html" target="_blank">ASUS ROG Swift</a>. ROG Swift is a great monitor for its time, a WQHD monitor running at 144Hz was a dream for most gamers. However, upgrading from a 16:9 TN panel to a 21:9 IPS panel is a significant upgrade.</p>
