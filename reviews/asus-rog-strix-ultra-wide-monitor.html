ASUS ROG Strix Ultra-wide Monitor (XG349C) Review

I purchased this monitor on Amazon for $699. Then the price of monitor went down by $10 while the package was enroute. I decided to contact the seller and asked them if they could give me a discount, and they responded shortly, and gave me a $10 refund. Very generous of them. 

The monitor is a renewed model. The price of the new model is $799 as of this writing (5/13/2022). 

I did not notice any issues with the monitor, cosmetic or otherwise.
