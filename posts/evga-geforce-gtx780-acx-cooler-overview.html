<p>I purchased the new <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130918" target="_blank">EVGA
        GeForce GTX 780 with ACX cooler</a> on June 5, 2013 for $659.99 + 3.99 shipping on NewEgg. Buying these high end
    cards on launch is a tricky deal. They are in stock for about 10 minutes before they are sold out. Of all the cards
    I have seen on NewEgg at the time, this one was the best in terms of factory overclocked settings. Even the awesome
    looking <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125464" target="_blank">Gigabyte
        model</a> had lower clock speeds.</p>

<p>The card is roughly the same size as the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130769"
        target="_blank">GeForce GTX680SC</a>. It should fit in almost any mid sized case.</p>

<p>It runs cooler than 680 and makes less noise. Those who have used the 680 would know that they hardly make any noise,
    I had to listen for it to even notice it. I was happy that the 780 performs even better.</p>

<p>Performance wise, the average frame rates are higher, the leap isn't all that big from a GeForce 680. Guild Wars 2.
    The frame rate certainly dips below 60 on ultra in Lion's Arch. Those who don't play Guild Wars 2, Lion's Arch is a
    hub where every player from level 1 to 80 would gather for something or the other. Its a highly populated area and
    there is always something or the other going on. Check out this video of Lion's Arch on ultra settings.</p>

<p>I was pretty impressed with the performance of the card in Battlefield 3. Here is a video of Battlefield 3 in ultra.

<p>Temperatures are lower on the 780, and that probably has a lot to do with the better cooling system on this card. I
    would absolutely recommend buying this instead of any reference model. Higher clock speeds, and better cooling
    system is definitely worth the extra $10. Quick note about the power connectors - 780 uses 1x6pin + 1x8pin
    PCI-express power connectors. This version of the card is bundled with the 8 pin power connector.</p>

<h2>Should 680 Owners Upgrade?</h2>

<p>Folks like me who like to own the latest GPU just as long as there are performance gains, probably already purchased
    the card. Those who are on the fence about it, should hold off. At the moment there is no reason to upgrade.
    Considering that the card is pretty expensive, there are no games at the moment that are taking full advantage of
    the GPU.</p>

<p>Of course, if a monitor upgrade is involved from 1080 to 1440, then an upgrade makes sense in order to play at the
    highest settings.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the 680 has plenty of life left in it. So I would hesitate to recommend an upgrade at the moment.</p>

<h2>Nvidia GeForce GTX 780 Compatibility with older BIOS</h2>
<p>I have a Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD5H motheboard, which was running with a stock BIOS, which was last updated on 3/12/2013.
    When I first installed the card, it would go to the BIOS screen and just sit there for a good minute. The LED debug
    code would show code 62 (Installation of the PCH runtime services). After about a minute, I would then be able to
    load windows. However, if I connected my other monitor, CD drive, data drive (non SSD drive) or if I hit Delete or
    End, the debug LED code would show one of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>AD (Issue Ready To Boot event for OS Boot)
    </li>
    <li>AE (Boot to Legacy OS)
    </li>
    <li>AB (Wait user command in BIOS Setup)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Once it reaches this point, it would just not do anything. I was under the impression that there was something wrong
    with the card itself, and I was quite disappointed.</p>

<p>My wife then had suggested that I should upgrade the BIOS. I looked up my BIOS date and version, and I realized it
    was quite old. I figured I should at least give it a shot.</p>

<p>I removed the 780, installed my 680, ran through the BIOS upgrade windows utility, and shut down my machine. Then I
    installed the 780 again and started the machine. This time around, I was through to the windows login screen in
    about a few seconds.</p>

<p>I was relieved to know that a BIOS upgrade was what was needed and there was nothing wrong with the card.</p>

<p>So my suggestion, first find out the version of the BIOS that is currently installed. This can be done through
    Windows. Having done this, find out if this version of BIOS is the latest, and if it is not, upgrade it before
    installing the GPU.</p>
