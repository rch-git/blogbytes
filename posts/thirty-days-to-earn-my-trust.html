I take no pleasure in writing this post. As a fan of Battlefield for over a decade, it saddens me to see the state of the game, and knowing that this could have all been avoided. 

As of April 4, 2022, it has been X days since the launch of the game on November X. There has been no new content, no fixes for existing problems, that players have been complaining right when the beta launched. However, we were all assured by the developer that the beta, which had a very bad launch was a build from an old branch, and the release branch was much better (or so they implied).

It should be noted that this person does not work at DICE anymore. 

<p>In my review of Battlefield 2042, I said the game had potential, and I stand by it. I really dislike the operators, and I wish we could go back to the player models from BF4 or BF3, but it is what is it. I was willing to put up with that if the rest of the pieces were in place. While it is not a total let down, and I did put close to 300 hours into the game, as of now, I am just disappointed with the state of Battlefield. </p>

When I wrote my review X months ago, I did not expect the progress from the development team to be as slow as it is. There has been one update since then, and they finally added a scoreboard, which isn't quite as good as the previous scoreboards (there is no scrolling). There was talk about an update to the game UI, which is a complete mess, but there was no word since. Simple UI options that existed in the previous games are still missing to this day, and there is no word about when they are going to be added if at all. 

DICE is currently reworking the maps, and they made a blog post about it, and they went into excruciating detail about how they are listening to the community and collecting feedback. 

The thing is, DICE doesn't need to do any of this. All they have to do is, play Battlefield 4 maps like Pearl Market, Dragon Valley 2015, Caspian Border 2014, Flood Zone, Zavod 311 are all excellent maps. Just emulate that. The fact that they are asking for community feedback on map design means that those that are working at DICE don't understand Battlefield. There is no other explanation for it. Anyone that played previous games would be able to point the flaws in map design. The lack of transport vehicles, lack of cover, terrible spawn experience all contribute towards making the player aggravated at the game. 

To add insult to injury, all said and done, they are only reworking only two maps. Considering that the game only launched with 7 maps, and while I enjoyed them, this rate of progress is extremely slow. In fact most of the issues can solved by simple adding some cover, and shrinking the side of the map. Take Hourglass for example, the good parts are pretty good, but the map can so boring part because of the large open spaces, and this is coming from someone who has enjoyed Bandar Desert in BF3. One of the main reasons for this is because Bandar Desert had transport vehicles, and it was easy enough to get from one point to the other. It really takes rare talent to increase the player count, and make the game boring because most of the time is spent running between objectives. Just goes to show that simply increasing the player count doesn't mean the game is going to be fun. 

Looking back at the statements made by the DICE team, there can only be two conclusions - they were either lying the whole time, or they genuinely thought they were shipping a quality product because what they said about the game, and what the game was actually like are very different things. 

So how is this any different than Battlefield 4? 2013 was a very different time. There wasn't as much competition in the multiplayer FPS games. Now you have Fortnite, Warzone, Apex legends, CSGO, PUBG all pulling in hundreds of thousands of players, so its very difficult for a bad game to recover. I don't necessarily think BF2042 is a bad game. I had more fun playing it than Battlefield V, which isn't saying much because to me, BFV is still the worst game in the franchise. But the game doesn't have good bones, which I think is the big problem here. 

Battlefield 4 had a good foundation, and even at its worst, there was still a lot of content, and the progression system was decent. So those of us who enjoy multiplayer shooters, there was still fun to be had, albeit, it was frustrating at times. 

With Battlefield 2042, I am 270 hours in, and I am out of things to do, which is very sad considering I barely explored Portal. The game is already dead. There are hardly any people playing at it. Its embarrassingly low. I think the numbers are worse than Hardline, which by the way is a very underrated game. 

So can DICE do what they did with Battlefield 4? No. I don't think so. At that time, there was an entire studio working on fixing Battlefield 4, and the game was getting weekly updates. They had the CTE, which was a fantastic idea because passionate players could play on CTE servers, and give feedback to DICE, and this feedback was used by DICE to make the base game, and future DLCs better. 

Also think of all the content that was available in Battlefield 4. There were over 30 maps! That's insane. They even had night versions of some of the popular maps available in CTE, but sadly all of them were never released to the public. 2015-2018 was such a great time to be a Battlefield player. You had Battlefield 4, Hardline, Battlefield 1 all launching within a 3 year period, and it was glorious. 

Now, there is no such thing. You had Battlefield V in 2018, which was awful, and it still is. Just when I thought they couldn't screw things up, they release this mess of a game, which I am not even sure why its called Battlefield at this point. They should have just released a Battle Royale game like they wanted to, and called it something else. Instead, they wanted to cash in on the popularity of Battlefield, but also wanted all those monetization opportunities of a hero shooter. You pick the worst things about gaming, and put it in one package, and you end up with this mess. 

I refuse to believe that a significant number of resources are allocated to fixing the game. If this is the case, we would be getting weekly or biweekly updates. It wouldn't take them 5 months to add a scoreboard. 

Imagine this, a multiplayer shooter launching in 2021 without a proper scoreboard. Who would have even though this would be something we would be talking about. What next, they will add in mouse and keyboard support after the fact in the game next? What other basic feature will be labeled as a legacy feature by the executives?

You would think as time passes, technology gets better, we would get better games, but no. We have a game on our hands that is worse than is in a worse shape than a game released 11 years ago at this point - Battlefield 3. 

So here is my pledge - I will not buy another Battlefield game at launch. I will wait for 60 days. No pre order bonus will tempt me to buy the game, and if I am ever tempted, I will read this post and tell myself, "Corporations have no morals, decency and on the best of days, they have a fleeting relationship with truth. They have the uncanny ability to blatantly lie to sell a few extra copies of their games, and most importantly, they don't about you, and have no respect for your money. Therefore, show some respect to your money, and hold on to it for a little bit longer. Do not buy the game at launch without reading reviews from non corporate game reviewers. And remember , under no circumstances, should you pre order the game."

The 60 day wait is a good thing because if DICE releases a game in October, it will be Christmas by the time I buy it, and I will enough free time to play the game over the holidays.

It is unfortunate that it has come to this, but DICE really made a mess with Battlefield 2042, and given all the turnover at the studio, there is a strong possibility that the best days of Battlefield are behind us.
